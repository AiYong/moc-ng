moc-ng:  a replacement for Qt's moc that is using clang libraries

This is really two project:

  * A plugin for clang which removes the needs of running moc
    if your code is compiled with this plugin.

  * A replacement for moc that aim to be compatible with qt's moc,
    but uses the clang libraries for the parsing step.
